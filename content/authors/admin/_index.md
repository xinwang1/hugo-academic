I am a Staff Researcher at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com/) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/Index). At Baidu Quantum, I focus on the research on quantum computing and the development of [Baidu Quantum Platform](https://quantum.baidu.com/). In particular, I lead the development of [Paddle Quantum](https://qml.baidu.com/), a Python library for quantum machine learning. My research investigates a broad range of perspectives of quantum computing and quantum information, including quantum communication, entanglement theory, near-term quantum applications, quantum machine learning, and quantum control. I am also an editor of [Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/).

I was a Hartree Postdoctoral Fellow at the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science ([QuICS](http://quics.umd.edu/people)) at the University of Maryland, College Park. I received my doctorate in quantum information from the University of Technology Sydney in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. [Runyao Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xcuO0hkAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Andreas Winter](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=UmMq2rEAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my B.S. in mathematics (with Wu Yuzhang Honor) from Sichuan University in 2014.  

I am a receipt of the **National Young Talents Project** (China),  Chancellor’s List for Outstanding Thesis (UTS),  Outstanding Self-financed Overseas Student Scholarship (China Scholarship Council).

A full list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BFkAPOQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [a](https://arxiv.org/a/wang_x_10.html)[rXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/wang_x_10.html). My full CV is available *[here]( https://www.xinwang.info/files/cv.pdf )*. 

***Hiring***: We are looking for *self-motivated* ***student interns*** interested in quantum computation, quantum machine learning, and quantum information (see, [知乎文章](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/94066205), or [中文主页](https://qclab.wang/post/intern/) ). If you are interested in joining the journey from the fundamentals of quantum information to the frontier of quantum computing industry, please feel free to contact!
