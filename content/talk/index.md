The detailed talk list could be found in my CV. More information will be updated in the future.

**My work has been presented at:**

- Conference on Quantum Information Processing (QIP)
- Asian Quantum Information Science Conference (AQIS)
- IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
- Workshop on Beyond I.I.D. in Information Theory (BIID)
- Conference on the Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication and Cryptography (TQC)
- AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)

The Conference on Quantum Information Processing (**QIP**) is the most competitive and important conference in quantum information science. **AQIS** and **TQC** are both international leading conferences in the field of quantum information, and **ISIT** is the main event in information theory. 

In the following list, (*) indicates delivery by my co-author.
