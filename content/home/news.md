- 2021.08, our work "[LOCCNet](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2101.12190)" on exploring distributed quantum information processing protocols with machine learning was accepted as a talk at [AQIS 2021](http://aqis-conf.org/2021/). Discover novel improved LOCC protocols for entanglement distillation. The [module](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/loccnet/loccnet-framework.html) was available on [Paddle Quantum](https://qml.baidu.com/) (a quantum machine learning toolkit).
