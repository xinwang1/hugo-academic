abstract = {Quantum gates and measurements on quantum hardware are inevitably subject to hardware imperfections that lead to quantum errors. Mitigating such unavoidable errors is crucial to explore the power of quantum hardware better. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that can mitigate quantum gate and measurement errors in computing quantum expectation values utilizing the truncated Neumann series. The essential idea is to cancel the effect of quantum error by approximating its inverse via linearly combining quantum errors of different orders produced by sequential applications of the quantum devices with carefully chosen coefficients. Remarkably, the estimation error decays exponentially in the truncated order, and the incurred error mitigation overhead is independent of the system size, as long as the noise resistance of the quantum device is moderate. We numerically test this framework for different quantum errors and find that the computation accuracy is substantially improved. Our framework possesses several vital advantages: it mitigates quantum gate and measurement errors in a unified manner, it neither assumes any error structure nor requires the tomography procedure to completely characterize the quantum errors, and most importantly, it is scalable. These advantages empower our quantum error mitigation framework to be efficient and practical and extend the ability of near-term quantum devices to deliver quantum applications.},

abstract = {A paradigmatic algorithm for online learning is the Hedge algorithm by Freund and Schapire. An allocation into different strategies is chosen for multiple rounds and each round incurs corresponding losses for each strategy. The algorithm obtains a favorable guarantee for the total losses even in an adversarial situation. This work presents quantum algorithms for such online learning in an oracular setting. For T time steps and N strategies, we exhibit run times of about Opoly(T)N for estimating the losses and for betting on individual strategies by sampling. In addition, we discuss a quantum analog of the Sparsitron, a machine learning algorithm based on the Hedge algorithm. The quantum algorithm inherits the provable learning guarantees from the classical algorithm and exhibits polynomial speedups. The speedups may find relevance in finance, for example, for hedging risks, and machine learning, for example, for learning generalized linear models or Ising models.},

abstract = {We develop a resource theory of symmetric distinguishability, the fundamental objects of which are elementary quantum information sources, i.e. sources that emit one of two possible quantum states with given prior probabilities. Such a source can be represented by a classical-quantum state of a composite system XA , corresponding to an ensemble of two quantum states, with X being classical and A being quantum. We study the resource theory for two different classes of free operations: (i) CPTP A , which consists of quantum channels acting only on A , and (ii) conditional doubly stochastic maps acting on XA . We introduce the notion of symmetric distinguishability of an elementary source and prove that it is a monotone under both these classes of free operations. We study the tasks of distillation and dilution of symmetric distinguishability, both in the one-shot and asymptotic regimes. We prove that in the asymptotic regime, the optimal rate of converting one elementary source to another is equal to the ratio of their quantum Chernoff divergences, under both these classes of free operations. This imparts a new operational interpretation to the quantum Chernoff divergence. We also obtain interesting operational interpretations of the Thompson metric, in the context of the dilution of symmetric distinguishability.},

abstract = {We introduce magic measures for multi-qubit quantum gates and establish lower bounds on the non-Clifford resources for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we introduce the stabilizer nullity of an arbitrary multi-qubit unitary, which is based on the subgroup of the quotient Pauli group associated with the unitary. This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state stabilizer nullity by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version. We in particular show this magic measure has desirable properties such as sub-additivity under composition and additivity under tensor product. Second, we prove that a given unitary's stabilizer nullity is a lower bound for the T-count, utilizing the above properties in gate synthesis. Third, we compare the state and the unitary stabilizer nullity, proving that the lower bounds for the T-count obtained by the unitary stabilizer nullity are never less than the state stabilizer nullity. Moreover, we show an explicit $n$-qubit unitary family of unitary stabilizer nullity $2n$, which implies that its T-count is at least $2n$. This gives an example where the bounds derived by the unitary stabilizer nullity strictly outperform the state stabilizer nullity by a factor of $2$. We further connect the unitary stabilizer nullity and the state stabilizer nullity with auxiliary systems, showing that adding auxiliary systems and choosing proper stabilizer states can strictly improving the lower bound obtained by the state stabilizer nullity.},

abstract = {Distributed quantum information processing is essential for building quantum networks and enabling more extensive quantum computations. In this regime, several spatially separated parties share a multipartite quantum system, and the most natural set of operations are Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). As a pivotal part in quantum information theory and practice, LOCC has led to many vital protocols such as quantum teleportation. However, designing practical LOCC protocols is challenging due to LOCC's intractable structure and limitations set by near-term quantum devices. Here we introduce LOCCNet, a machine learning framework facilitating protocol design and optimization for distributed quantum information processing tasks. As applications, we explore various quantum information tasks such as entanglement distillation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum channel simulation. We discover novel protocols with evident improvements, in particular, for entanglement distillation with quantum states of interest in quantum information. Our approach opens up new opportunities for exploring entanglement and its applications with machine learning, which will potentially sharpen our understanding of the power and limitations of LOCC.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum technology, and its quantification is a vital task in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This paper combines hybrid quantum-classical computation and quasi-probability decomposition to propose two variational quantum algorithms, called Variational Entanglement Detection (VED) and Variational Logarithmic Negativity Estimation (VLNE), for detecting and quantifying entanglement on near-term quantum devices, respectively. VED makes use of the positive map criterion and works as follows. Firstly, it decomposes a positive map into a combination of quantum operations implementable on near-term quantum devices. It then variationally estimates the minimal eigenvalue of the final state, obtained by executing these implementable operations on the target state and averaging the output states. Deterministic and probabilistic methods are proposed to compute the average. At last, it asserts that the target state is entangled if the optimized minimal eigenvalue is negative. VLNE builds upon a linear decomposition of the transpose map into Pauli terms and the recently proposed trace distance estimation algorithm. It variationally estimates the well-known logarithmic negativity entanglement measure and could be applied to quantify entanglement on near-term quantum devices. Experimental and numerical results on the Bell state, isotropic states, and Breuer states show the validity of the proposed entanglement detection and quantification methods.},

In this work, we discuss the fundamental properties and limitations of the standard quantum autoencoder model in more depth, and provide an information-theoretic solution to its recovering fidelity. Based on this understanding, we present a noise-assisted quantum autoencoder algorithm to go beyond the limitations, our model can achieve high recovering fidelity for general input states. Appropriate noise channels are used to make the input mixedness and output mixedness consistent, the noise setup is determined by measurement results of the trash system. Compared with the original quantum autoencoder model, the measurement information is fully used in our algorithm. In addition to the circuit model, we design a (noise-assisted) adiabatic model of quantum autoencoder that can be implemented on quantum annealers. We verified the validity of our methods through compressing the thermal states of transverse field Ising model. For pure state ensemble compression, we also introduce a projected quantum autoencoder algorithm. Our models have wide applications for quantum data compression on near-term quantum devices.},

abstract = {Completely positive and trace-preserving maps characterize physically implementable quantum operations. On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation has no advantage over local error mitigation.},

However, as typical characterizations of quantum data similarity, the trace distance and quantum fidelity are believed to be exponentially-hard to evaluate in general. In this work, we introduce hybrid quantum–classical algorithms for these two distance measures on near-term quantum devices where no assumption of input state is required. First, we introduce the variational trace distance estimation (VTDE) algorithm. We in particular provide the technique to extract the desired spectrum information of any Hermitian matrix by local measurement. A novel variational algorithm for trace distance estimation is then derived from this technique, with the assistance of a single ancillary qubit. Notably, VTDE could avoid the barren plateau issue with logarithmic depth circuits due to a local cost function. Second, we introduce the variational fidelity estimation algorithm. We combine Uhlmann's theorem and the freedom in purification to translate the estimation task into an optimization problem over a unitary on an ancillary system with fixed purified inputs. We then provide a purification subroutine to complete the translation. Both algorithms are verified by numerical simulations and experimental implementations, exhibiting high accuracy for randomly generated mixed states.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 American Physical Society. The logarithmic negativity of a bipartite quantum state is a widely employed entanglement measure in quantum information theory due to the fact that it is easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement. More recently, the $\kappa$ entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be an entanglement measure that is both easily computable and has a precise information-theoretic meaning, being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose [Xin Wang and Mark M. Wilde, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 040502 (2020)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.125.040502]. In this paper, we provide a nontrivial link between these two entanglement measures by showing that they are the extremes of an ordered family of $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures, each of which is identified by a parameter $\alpha$?1,∞. In this family, the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with $\alpha$=1, and the $\kappa$ entanglement is recovered as the largest with $\alpha$=∞. We prove that the $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity satisfies the following properties: entanglement monotone, normalization, faithfulness, and subadditivity. We also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous. Finally, we define the $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as a generalization of the notion for quantum states, and we show how to generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement is a key physical resource in quantum information processing that allows for performing basic quantum tasks such as teleportation and quantum key distribution, which are impossible in the classical world. Ever since the rise of quantum information theory, it has been an open problem to quantify entanglement in an information-theoretically meaningful way. In particular, every previously defined entanglement measure bearing a precise information-theoretic meaning is not known to be efficiently computable, or if it is efficiently computable, then it is not known to have a precise information-theoretic meaning. In this Letter, we meet this challenge by introducing an entanglement measure that has a precise information-theoretic meaning as the exact cost required to prepare an entangled state when two distant parties are allowed to perform quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose. Additionally, this entanglement measure is efficiently computable by means of a semidefinite program, and it bears a number of useful properties such as additivity and faithfulness. Our results bring key insights into the fundamental entanglement structure of arbitrary quantum states, and they can be used directly to assess and quantify the entanglement produced in quantum-physical experiments.},

Furthermore, we conduct numerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications in image compression of handwritten digits. Finally, we discuss the applications of our algorithm in recommendation systems and polar decomposition.

In the previous work, the algorithms are worst-case optimal in general but fail in achieving tighter bounds in certain simpler or more practical cases. In this paper, we develop algorithms to advance the online learning of quantum states. First, we show that Regularized Follow-the-Leader (RFTL) method with Tallis-2 entropy can achieve an $O(\sqrt{MT})$ total loss with perfect hindsight on the first $T$ measurements with maximum rank $M$. This regret bound depends only on the maximum rank $M$ of measurements rather than the number of qubits, which takes advantage of low-rank measurements. Second, we propose a parameter-free algorithm based on a classical adjusting learning rate schedule that can achieve a regret depending on the loss of best states in hindsight, which takes advantage of low noisy outcomes. Besides these more adaptive bounds, we also show that our RFTL with Tallis-2 entropy algorithm can be implemented efficiently on near-term quantum computing devices, which is not achievable in previous works.},

In this paper, we derive single-letter upper bounds on the quantum and private capacities of quantum channels. The quantum capacity of a quantum channel is always no larger than the quantum capacity of its extended channels since the extensions of the channel can be considered as assistance from the environment. By optimizing the parametrized extended channels with specific structures such as the flag structure, we obtain new upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the original quantum channel. Furthermore, we extend our approach to estimating the fundamental limits of private communication and one-way entanglement distillation. As notable applications, we establish improved upper bounds to the quantum and private capacities for fundamental quantum channels of great interest in quantum information, some of which are also the sources of noise in superconducting quantum computing. In particular, our upper bounds on the quantum capacities of the depolarizing channel and the generalized amplitude damping channel are strictly better than previously best-known bounds.},

abstract = {The unextendibility or monogamy of entangled states is a key property of quantum entanglement. Unlike conventional ways of expressing entanglement monogamy via entanglement measure inequalities, we develop a state-dependent resource theory to quantify the unextendibility of bipartite entangled states. First, we introduce a family of entanglement measures called unextendible entanglement. Given a bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$, the key idea behind these measures is to minimize a divergence between $\rho_{AB}$ and any possibly reduced state $\rho_{AB'}$ of an extension $\rho_{ABB'}$ of $\rho_{AB}$. These measures are intuitively motivated by the fact that the more a bipartite state is entangled, the less that each of its individual systems can be entangled with a third party. Second, we show that the unextendible entanglement is an entanglement monotone under two-extendible operations, which include local operations and one-way classical communication as a special case. Unextendible entanglement has several other desirable properties, including normalization and faithfulness. As applications, we show that the unextendible entanglement provides efficiently computable benchmarks for the rate of perfect secret key distillation or entanglement distillation, as well as for the overhead of probabilistic secret key or entanglement distillation.},

abstract = {The difficulty of simulating quantum dynamics depends on the norm of the Hamiltonian. When the Hamiltonian varies with time, the simulation complexity should only depend on this quantity instantaneously. We develop quantum simulation algorithms that exploit this intuition. For sparse Hamiltonian simulation, the gate complexity scales with the L 1 norm ∫ 0 t d $\tau$ ‖ H ( $\tau$ ) ‖ max , whereas the best previous results scale with t max $\tau$ ∈ [ 0 , t ] ‖ H ( $\tau$ ) ‖ max . We also show analogous results for Hamiltonians that are linear combinations of unitaries. Our approaches thus provide an improvement over previous simulation algorithms that can be substantial when the Hamiltonian varies significantly. We introduce two new techniques: a classical sampler of time-dependent Hamiltonians and a rescaling principle for the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The rescaled Dyson-series algorithm is nearly optimal with respect to all parameters of interest, whereas the sampling-based approach is easier to realize for near-term simulation. These algorithms could potentially be applied to semi-classical simulations of scattering processes in quantum chemistry.},

abstract = {The traditional perspective in quantum resource theories concerns how to use free operations to convert one resourceful quantum state to another one. For example, a fundamental and well known question in entanglement theory is to determine the distillable entanglement of a bipartite state, which is equal to the maximum rate at which fresh Bell states can be distilled from many copies of a given bipartite state by employing local operations and classical communication for free. It is the aim of this paper to take this kind of question to the next level, with the main question being: What is the best way of using free channels to convert one resourceful quantum channel to another? Here we focus on the the resource theory of entanglement for bipartite channels and establish several fundamental tasks and results regarding it. In particular, we establish bounds on several pertinent information processing tasks in channel entanglement theory, and we define several entanglement measures for bipartite channels, including the logarithmic negativity and the $\kappa$-entanglement. We also show that the max-Rains information of [B\"auml et al., Physical Review Letters, 121, 250504 (2018)] has a divergence interpretation, which is helpful for simplifying the results of this earlier work.},

Establishing a general formalism which allows for a straightforward comparison of their exact achievable performance, we relate the fidelity of distillation under these classes of operations with a family of entanglement monotones and the rates of distillation with a class of smoothed entropic quantities based on the hypothesis testing relative entropy. We then characterise exactly the one-shot distillable entanglement of several classes of quantum states and reveal many simplifications in their manipulation. We show in particular that the $\varepsilon$-error one-shot distillable entanglement of any pure state is the same under all sets of operations ranging from one-way LOCC to separability-preserving operations or operations preserving the set of states with positive partial transpose, and can be computed exactly as a quadratically constrained linear program. We establish similar operational equivalences in the distillation of isotropic and maximally correlated states, reducing the computation of the relevant quantities to linear or semidefinite programs. We also show that all considered sets of operations achieve the same performance in environment-assisted entanglement distillation from any state.},

abstract = {This paper systematically develops the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability, as initiated roughly a decade ago [K. Matsumoto, arXiv:1010.1030 (2010)]. The key constituents of this resource theory are quantum boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum states, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum channel. We introduce bits of asymmetric distinguishability as the basic currency in this resource theory, and we prove that it is a reversible resource theory in the asymptotic limit, with the quantum relative entropy being the fundamental rate of resource interconversion. The distillable distinguishability is the optimal rate at which a quantum box consisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states can be converted to bits of asymmetric distinguishability, and the distinguishability cost is the optimal rate for the reverse transformation. Both of these quantities are equal to the quantum relative entropy. The exact one-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the min-relative entropy, and the exact one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the max-relative entropy. Generalizing these results, the approximate one-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the smooth min-relative entropy, and the approximate one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the smooth max-relative entropy. As a notable application of the former results, we prove that the optimal rate of asymptotic conversion from a pair of i.i.d. quantum states to another pair of i.i.d. quantum states is fully characterized by the ratio of their quantum relative entropies.},

abstract = {The logarithmic negativity of a bipartite quantum state is a widely employed entanglement measure in quantum information theory, due to the fact that it is easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement. More recently, the $\kappa$-entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be the first entanglement measure that is both easily computable and operationally meaningful, being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose. In this paper, we provide a non-trivial link between these two entanglement measures, by showing that they are the extremes of an ordered family of $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures, each of which is identified by a parameter $\alpha\in\left[ 1,\infty\right] $. In this family, the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with $\alpha=1$, and the $\kappa$-entanglement is recovered as the largest with $\alpha=\infty$. We prove that the $\alpha $-logarithmic negativity satisfies the following properties: full entanglement monotone, normalization, faithfulness, and subadditivity. We also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous. Finally, we define the $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as a generalization of the notion for quantum states, and we show how to generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories.},

abstract = {This paper develops the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability for quantum channels, generalizing the related resource theory for states [arXiv:1006.0302, arXiv:1905.11629]. The key constituents of the channel resource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum channels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum superchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel). One main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box transformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel box (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an asymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer than its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in which this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or $n$-shot regimes, with the latter having parallel and sequential variants. As in [arXiv:1905.11629], we consider two special cases of the general channel box transformation problem, known as distinguishability distillation and dilution. For the one-shot case, we find that the optimal values of the various tasks are equal to the non-smooth or smooth channel min- or max-relative entropies, thus endowing all of these quantities with operational interpretations. In the asymptotic sequential setting, we prove that the exact distinguishability cost is equal to channel max-relative entropy and the distillable distinguishability is equal to the amortized channel relative entropy of [arXiv:1808.01498]. This latter result can also be understood as a solution to Stein's lemma for quantum channels in the sequential setting. Finally, the theory simplifies significantly for environment-seizable and classical--quantum channel boxes.},

abstract = {To achieve universal quantum computation via general fault-tolerant schemes, stabilizer operations must be supplemented with other non-stabilizer quantum resources. Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic quantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum "magic" or non-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with odd dimension $d$, it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner function can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this observation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely positive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show that they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we introduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels, called the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that these measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of quantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of synthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for simulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by the mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can outperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on channel robustness. Finally, we explore the threshold of non-stabilizerness for basic quantum circuits under depolarizing noise.},

abstract = {Magic state manipulation is a crucial component in the leading approaches to realizing scalable, fault-tolerant, and universal quantum computation. Related to magic state manipulation is the resource theory of magic states, for which one of the goals is to characterize and quantify quantum "magic." In this paper, we introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of magic in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures to address several open questions in the resource theory of magic states. As a first application, we use the min-thauma to bound the regularized relative entropy of magic. As a consequence of this bound, we find that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established magic measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime at a rate equal to one. This result resolves a basic question in the resource theory of magic states and reveals a fundamental difference between the resource theory of magic states and other resource theories such as entanglement and coherence. As a second application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as an efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable magic, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at which magic can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of magic state distillation. Finally, we prove that the max-thauma can outperform mana in benchmarking the efficiency of magic state distillation.},

First, we establish that the exact entanglement cost of any bipartite quantum state under PPT-preserving operations is given by a single-letter formula, here called the $\kappa$-entanglement of a quantum state. This formula is calculable by a semidefinite program, thus allowing for an efficiently computable solution for general quantum states. Notably, this is the first time that an entanglement measure for general bipartite states has been proven not only to possess a direct operational meaning but also to be efficiently computable, thus solving a question that has remained open since the inception of entanglement theory over two decades ago. Next, we introduce and solve the exact entanglement cost for simulating quantum channels in both the parallel and sequential settings, along with the assistance of free PPT-preserving operations. The entanglement cost in both cases is given by the same single-letter formula and is equal to the largest $\kappa$-entanglement that can be shared by the sender and receiver of the channel. It is also efficiently computable by a semidefinite program.},

Here we develop a general framework of probabilistic distillation of quantum coherence, characterizing the maximal probability of success in the operational task of extracting maximally coherent states in a one-shot setting. We investigate distillation under different classes of free operations, highlighting differences in their capabilities and establishing their fundamental limitations in state transformations. We first provide a geometric interpretation for the maximal success probability, showing that under maximally incoherent operations (MIO) and dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO) the problem can be further simplified in to efficiently computable semidefinite programs. Exploiting these results, we find that DIO and its subset of strictly incoherent operations (SIO) have equal power in probabilistic distillation of coherence from pure input states, while MIO are strictly stronger. We prove a fundamental no-go result: distilling coherence from any full-rank state is impossible even probabilistically. We then present a phenomenon which prohibits any trade-off between the maximal success probability and the distillation fidelity beyond a certain threshold. Finally, we consider probabilistic distillation assisted by a catalyst and demonstrate, with specific examples, its superiority to the deterministic case.},

abstract = {Coherent superposition is a key feature of quantum mechanics that underlies the advantage of quantum technologies over their classical counterparts. Recently, coherence has been recast as a resource theory in an attempt to identify and quantify it in an operationally well-defined manner. Here we study how the coherence present in a state can be used to implement a quantum channel via incoherent operations and, in turn, to assess its degree of coherence. We introduce the robustness of coherence of a quantum channel-which reduces to the homonymous measure for states when computed on constant-output channels-and prove that: i) it quantifies the minimal rank of a maximally coherent state required to implement the channel; ii) its logarithm quantifies the amortized cost of implementing the channel provided some coherence is recovered at the output; iii) its logarithm also quantifies the zero-error asymptotic cost of implementation of many independent copies of a channel. We also consider the generalized problem of imperfect implementation with arbitrary resource states. Using the robustness of coherence, we find that in general a quantum channel can be implemented without employing a maximally coherent resource state. In fact, we prove that every pure coherent state in dimension larger than 2 , however weakly so, turns out to be a valuable resource to implement some coherent unitary channel. We illustrate our findings for the case of single-qubit unitary channels.},

Based on this, we obtain improved SDP finite blocklength converse bounds for general quantum channels, which also reduce to the converse bound of Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verd\'{u} for classical channels. Furthermore, we derive two SDP strong converse bounds for the classical capacity of a general quantum channel: for any code with a rate exceeding either of the two bounds of the channel, the success probability vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. In particular, applying our efficiently computable bounds, we derive improved upper bounds to the classical capacity of the class of amplitude damping channels. Remarkably, we also establish the strong converse property for the classical and private capacities of a new class of quantum channels. We finally study the zero-error setting and provide efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot zero-error capacity of a general quantum channel.},

Our framework allows us to characterize the structure and properties of quantum resource theories specialized to Gaussian states and Gaussian operations, establishing rigorous methods for their description and yielding a unified approach to their quantification. We show in particular that, under a few intuitive and physically motivated assumptions on the set of free states, no Gaussian quantum resource can be distilled with free Gaussian operations, even when an unlimited supply of the resource state is available. This places fundamental constraints on state manipulations in all such Gaussian resource theories. We discuss in particular the applications to quantum entanglement, where we extend previously known results by showing that Gaussian entanglement cannot be distilled even with Gaussian operations preserving the positivity of the partial transpose, as well as to other Gaussian resources such as steering and optical nonclassicality. A comprehensive semidefinite programming representation of all these resources is explicitly provided.},

abstract = {Non-asymptotic entanglement distillation studies the trade-off between three parameters: the distillation rate, the number of independent and identically distributed prepared states, and the fidelity of the distillation. We first study the one-shot {\epsilon}-infidelity distillable entanglement under quantum operations that completely preserve positivity of the partial transpose (PPT) and characterize it as a semidefinite program (SDP). For isotropic states, it can be further simplified to a linear program. The one-shot {\epsilon}-infidelity PPT- assisted distillable entanglement can be transformed to a quantum hypothesis testing problem. Moreover, we show efficiently computable second-order upper and lower bounds for the non-asymptotic distillable entanglement with a given infidelity tolerance. Utilizing these bounds, we obtain the second order asymptotic expansions of the optimal distillation rates for pure states and some classes of mixed states. In particular, this result recovers the second-order expansion of LOCC distillable entanglement for pure states in [Datta/Leditzky, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 61:582, 2015]. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for calculating the Rains bound and present direct numerical evidence (not involving any other entanglement measures, as in [Wang/Duan, Phys. Rev.

abstract = {We study the problem of transforming a tripartite state to a bipartite one using stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). It is known that the one-shot tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is completely determined by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest Schmidt rank of those bipartite states lying in the range of the reduced density operator. In this paper, we obtain results in tripartite-to-bipartite entanglement transformation, in both finite and asymptotic settings, by studying properties of the maximal Schmidt rank. In the finite setting, we first show that the maximal Schmidt rank is super-multiplicative, i.e., the maximal Schmidt rank of two copies of a given state can be strictly larger than the square of its maximal Schmidt rank. We then provide a complete characterization of those tripartite states satisfying this property. Note that such tripartite states admit advantages in tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC transformation when multiple copies are supplied. In the asymptotic setting, we introduce the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank of a tri- partite state, which can be understood as the largest possible Schmidt rank one can obtain from a single copy of the given tripartite state under SLOCC, asymptotically. We first compute the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank for a large family of tripartite states explicitly. Then, combined with certain powerful results from invariant theory, we exhibit a sufficient and necessary condition to determine whether a single copy of a given tripartite state can be transformed to the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in this asymptotic setting. Thanks to the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, our condition can be verified in deterministic polynomial time.},

Before our work, it was unknown whether the one-shot (or asymptotic) no-signalling assisted zero-error classical simulation cost for general non-commutative graphs is multiplicative (resp. additive) or not. In this paper we address these issues and give a general sufficient condition for the multiplicativity of the one-shot simulation cost and the additivity of the asymptotic simulation cost of non-commutative bipartite graphs, which include all known cases such as extremal graphs and classical-quantum graphs. Applying this condition, we exhibit a large class of so-called cheapest-full-rank graphs whose asymptotic zero-error simulation cost is given by the one-shot simulation cost. Finally, we disprove the multiplicativity of one-shot simulation cost by explicitly constructing a special class of qubit-qutrit non-commutative bipartite graphs.},

We show that a subspace is strongly PPT-unextendible if it contains a PPT-definite operator (a positive semidefinite operator whose partial transpose is positive definite). Based on these, we are able to propose a simple criterion for verifying whether a set of bipartite orthogonal quantum states is indistinguishable by PPT operations in the many copy scenario. Utilizing this criterion, we further point out that any entangled pure state and its orthogonal complement cannot be distinguished by PPT operations in the many copy scenario. On the other hand, we investigate that the minimum dimension of strongly PPT-unextendible subspaces in an $m\otimes n$ system is $m+n-1$, which involves a generalization of the result that non-positive-partial-transpose (NPT) subspaces can be as large as any entangled subspace [N.

First, we show that the one-shot activated capacity can be formulated as a semidefinite program and we derive a number of striking properties of this capacity. We further present a sufficient condition under which a noisy channel can be activated. Second, we show that one-bit noiseless classical communication is able to fully activate any classical-quantum channel to achieve its asymptotic capacity, or the semidefinite (or fractional) packing number. Third, we prove that the asymptotic activated capacity cannot exceed the original asymptotic capacity of any quantum channel. We also show that the asymptotic no-signalling-assisted zero-error capacity does not equal to the semidefinite packing number for quantum channels, which differs from the case of classical-quantum channels.},
