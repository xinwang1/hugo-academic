abstract: "Non-asymptotic entanglement distillation studies the trade-off between three parameters: the distillation rate, the number of independent and identically distributed prepared states, and the fidelity of the distillation. We first study the one-shot ε-infidelity distillable entanglement under quantum operations that completely preserve positivity of the partial transpose (PPT) and characterize it as a semidefinite program (SDP). For isotropic states, it can be further simplified to a linear program. The one-shot ε-infidelity PPT- assisted distillable entanglement can be transformed to a quantum hypothesis testing problem. Moreover, we show efficiently computable second-order upper and lower bounds for the non-asymptotic distillable entanglement with a given infidelity tolerance. Utilizing these bounds, we obtain the second order asymptotic expansions of the optimal distillation rates for pure states and some classes of mixed states. In particular, this result recovers the second-order expansion of LOCC distillable entanglement for pure states in [Datta/Leditzky, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 61:582, 2015]. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for calculating the Rains bound and present direct numerical evidence (not involving any other entanglement measures, as in [Wang/Duan, Phys. Rev. A 95:062322, 2017]), showing that the Rains bound is not additive under tensor products."
