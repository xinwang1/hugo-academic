abstract: "The logarithmic negativity of a bipartite quantum state is a widely employed entanglement measure in quantum information theory, due to the fact that it is easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement. More recently, the $ąppa$-entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be the first entanglement measure that is both easily computable and operationally meaningful, being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose. In this paper, we provide a non-trivial link between these two entanglement measures, by showing that they are the extremes of an ordered family of $α$-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures, each of which is identified by a parameter $αınłeft[ 1,ınftyi̊ght] $. In this family, the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with $α=1$, and the $p̨pa$-entanglement is recovered as the largest with $α=ınfty$. We prove that the $α $-logarithmic negativity satisfies the following properties: full entanglement monotone, normalization, faithfulness, and subadditivity. We also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous. Finally, we define the $α$-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as a generalization of the notion for quantum states, and we show how to generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories."
